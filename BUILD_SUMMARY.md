# Security Toolkit Container - Build Summary

## Build Status: ✅ SUCCESSFUL

### Container Details
- **Image Name**: security-toolkit:latest
- **Base Image**: debian:stable-slim
- **Build Time**: ~3-5 minutes (depending on hardware)
- **Final Image Size**: ~2.5GB (includes compiled tools and libraries)

## Included Tools

### ✅ Web Fuzzers
1. **ffuf** (v2.1.0-dev)
   - Fast web fuzzer written in Go
   - Compiled from source
   - Location: `/usr/local/bin/ffuf`

2. **gobuster**
   - Directory/file & DNS busting tool
   - Compiled from source with Go 1.23.4
   - Location: `/usr/local/bin/gobuster`

3. **dirb** (v2.22)
   - Web content scanner
   - Installed from Debian repository
   - Location: `/usr/bin/dirb`

4. **wfuzz**
   - ⚠️ Note: Skipped due to Python 3.13 compatibility issues with pycurl
   - Alternative tools (ffuf, gobuster, dirb) provide similar functionality

### ✅ Password Crackers
1. **John the Ripper** (v1.9.0-jumbo-1+bleeding)
   - Compiled from source with full optimizations
   - Location: `/opt/john/run/john`
   - **Usage**: `/opt/john/run/john [options]`
   - Includes all utilities (zip2john, rar2john, etc.)

2. **hashcat** (v7.1.2)
   - Advanced password recovery (CPU mode)
   - Compiled from source
   - Location: `/usr/local/bin/hashcat`
   - OpenCL support included (PoCL)

### ✅ Development Tools
1. **Python 3.13.5**
   - Includes pip3
   - Installed security libraries:
     - requests (HTTP library)
     - beautifulsoup4 (HTML/XML parsing)
     - selenium (browser automation)
     - paramiko (SSH client)
     - pycryptodome (cryptographic library)
     - scapy (packet manipulation)

2. **Go 1.23.4**
   - Full Go compiler and runtime
   - Used to build ffuf and gobuster

3. **System Tools**
   - git, curl, wget
   - nano text editor
   - build-essential (gcc, make, etc.)

## Known Issues and Workarounds

### 1. John the Ripper Path
**Issue**: John is not in the default PATH
**Workaround**: Use full path `/opt/john/run/john` or create an alias:
```bash
alias john='/opt/john/run/john'
```

### 2. John Log File Permissions
**Issue**: Permission denied when writing to `/opt/john/run/john.log` when running as secuser
**Workaround**: Run as root for full functionality or ignore the warning

### 3. wfuzz Not Included
**Issue**: Python package has metadata issues with pip 24.1+
**Solution**: Use alternative tools (ffuf, gobuster, dirb) which provide similar functionality

## Usage Examples

### Basic Interactive Usage
```bash
docker run -it -v "$(pwd)":/workspace security-toolkit:latest
```

### Run Specific Tool
```bash
# ffuf example
docker run --rm -v "$(pwd)":/workspace security-toolkit:latest \
  ffuf -u http://example.com/FUZZ -w wordlist.txt

# hashcat benchmark
docker run --rm security-toolkit:latest hashcat -b

# John the Ripper
docker run --rm -v "$(pwd)":/workspace security-toolkit:latest \
  /opt/john/run/john --wordlist=wordlist.txt hashes.txt
```

### Python Security Scripts
```bash
docker run --rm -v "$(pwd)":/workspace security-toolkit:latest \
  python3 /workspace/your-script.py
```

## Build Optimizations

The build process was optimized for:
1. **Time**: Compiling tools from source takes 3-5 minutes total
2. **Functionality**: All major security tools included
3. **Security**: Runs as non-root user (secuser) by default
4. **Size**: Efficient layer caching for faster rebuilds

## Testing

All tools have been verified working:
- ✅ ffuf: Tested and functional
- ✅ gobuster: Tested and functional
- ✅ dirb: Tested and functional
- ✅ John the Ripper: Tested and functional (use full path)
- ✅ hashcat: Tested with benchmark mode
- ✅ Python 3: Tested with all security libraries
- ✅ Go: Tested and functional

## Files Created

1. **Dockerfile** - Complete container definition
2. **README.md** - User documentation
3. **test-tools.sh** - Quick tool verification script
4. **demo-test.sh** - Extended demo with actual tool usage
5. **BUILD_SUMMARY.md** - This file

## Conclusion

The security toolkit container has been successfully built and tested. It provides a comprehensive environment for:
- Web application security testing
- Password cracking and analysis
- Security research and development
- Python security scripting

All requirements from REQUIREMENTS.md have been met, with the exception of wfuzz (replaced by equivalent tools).
